# Sales dataset
This repo contains analyses on the [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).

## `predict_basket`
This predicts whether the final basket value of a customer will be high, medium, or low based on a single item currently in their basket, by using classification techniques. The aim of this notebook was just to create a project where I can brush up on some skills as it had been a couple of months since working on an ML project.

## `cohort_analysis`
This performs Cohort analysis, as per a [datacamp tutorial](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/customer-segmentation-in-python/cohort-analysis?ex=3), via [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-customer-retention-rates-cohort-analysis-yuan-yexi/) LinkedIn post. This was initially to help a potential client understand this problem, but I continued with it as it was interesting.

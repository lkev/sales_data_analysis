# Sales dataset
This repo contains analyses on the [UCI Online Retail Dataset].

## `cohort_analysis`
This performs Cohort analysis, as per a [datacamp tutorial]

## `predict_basket`
This predicts whether the final basket value of a customer will be high, medium, or low based on a single item currently in their basket, by using classification techniques. The aim of this notebook was just to create a project where I can brush up on some skills as well as demonstrate my ML knowledge, due to most projects I work on being closed-source or protected by NDA.
